## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

This application is deployed to Heroku, **[click here](https://climb-of-death.herokuapp.com/)**.

Upon loading the landing page, the user is given a choice to sign up or login to *Climb of Death*. The user must login in order to play *Climb of Death*. Once logged in, the user will be directed to the adventure start. 

The user must click buttons to start and play the adventure. A block of text will provide content for your scenario. 

Beneath the scenario, the user will have one or many buttons representing choices. Upon clicking a choice, the user will be brought into a new scenario with new choices.

As the user makes more choices the story will develop and feel unique to the user as their choices affect the decision tree and the story pathway.

If the user wishes to end their session, then they can log out or close the browser or browser tab.

Upon logging back in, the user will start on the page they left.
