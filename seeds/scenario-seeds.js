Recently, you learned about a small island off the coast of Java from your late mentor. This island is shrouded in mystery as a large and icy mountain appeared in the center of the island overnight about a year ago. As the sun rises, a chilling breeze floats across the sea and sunlight hits the large mountain in the center of the island. Aboard the Explorers deck, you witness a golden light exposing the peak of the mountain. A memory enters your mind, "Climb the Mountain of Death and seek riches beyond your wildest dreams." The familiar voice of your mentor fades as you gaze up at a mountainous mountain, a burly boulder of ice and snow, and a shiphand shouts, “Land ho! We are nearing the docks of the village of Kode!” How do you feel at this moment?`,

You are sure there are monsters and treasures abound, but know that you must be prepared for danger and surprise. For a moment, all you hear is the wind and peace draws close. Your nose picks up a scent of rot and terrible body odor. You need to find a bathouse in the village before climbing the mountain. What do you choose to do as the Explorer tradeship docks in the village of Kode?`,

You ask where the bathhouse is located and they point you towards the end of town. A blue painted wooden cabin sits with buckets next to it and rags on a drying rack.`,
