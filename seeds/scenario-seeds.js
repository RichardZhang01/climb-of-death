A memory enters your mind, <i>climb the Mountain of Death and seek riches beyond your wildest dreams.</i> The familiar voice of your mentor fades as you gaze up at a mountainous mountain, a burly boulder of ice and snow, and a shiphand shouts, â€œLand ho! We are nearing the docks of the village of Kode!"</p>

        content: `<p class="mb-5">The brown soft object feels calming to touch. Your vision clears and you see a notebook in your hand. A beautiful leatherbound book wrapped in leather bindings sits between your fingers.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">You unwrap the book and begin to read the contents. You learn about the Sea of Java, the Island of Death, the village of Kode, and the newly formed Mountain of Death.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-5">You reach the end of the story and learn about a person who reached the top and failed to break the curse of the island. You look up at the horizon and see a dark storm headed toward the top of the mountain.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-5">The calm atmosphere of the mountaintop is unsettling at this moment. You experienced a long journey, but with no way down the mountain and a storm coming, you feel as though the end will be short.</p>

        // Scenario 39
        content: `<p class="mb-5">The transparent ball object has a certain heft to it. Your vision clears as you see a snowglobe of the very island you are on! The intricacy of the island, mountain and village takes your attention. You shake the snow globe and snow begins to fall on the mountaintop.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">You snow land on your neck and shoulders. You look up and snow begins to fall upon the Mountain of Death, the wind picks up, and you shiver. You look at where you entered from only to see the clouds have risen to obscure your vision.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-5">There is no escape from the mountain. You quickly succumb to the weather as hypothermia overtakes your body. The snow globe rolls out of your hands and lands perfectly where it once sat with snow softly falling on the replica island, mountain and village.</p>
